Beauty Bar
------------------------

Project to make bars look nicer.

TODOs
------------------------

<host> = beauty-bar.appspot.com

Control generators (PRIO 2)
--------
(done some, needs improvement though)
Make generators controllable through UI.
+ change background image
  + color
  + image (clipart vs. upload)
+ preload generator parts

Write architecture design (PRIO 2)
--------
+ structure of model/view/controller
+ services (svg-to-png, live-data-import, image-store)
+ generator interface
+ database interface
  - database tools?
+ hooks for information collection
  - use meter
+ logging?
+ naming conventions / file system
+ use staticmethods? or only classmethods

Tools to process SVG (PRIO 3)
--------
+ extract bars from svg
+ make generator skel based on svg image?
+ mofify svg size?
+ find more tools?! Inkscape is good, but more?

Style formatter (PRIO 2)
--------
One can first create a style with beautybar by choosing
bar type and options. Then one can use that style within
his blog with various data by calling:
http://<host>/style/<style_name>?data="one",1;"hello world",2; ...
make google Chart API compatible

Change to use JQuery library (PRIO 1)
--------
Design look-and-feel.

Store images to db (PRIO 5 - POSTPONED)
--------
  + svg to png conversion
   --> tried twice, do not support python tools to make it,
       and Batik (Java) cannot be used as it uses java.awt.
  + make images accessible later on
    (http://<host>/s/<image_name>(.svg|.png)
  + use memcache 

Testing (PRIO 4)
--------
+ test with other browsers
 + opera
 + internet explorer
+ test with many users
+ write test plan
+ write some automate tests to verify that atleast something works
  before upload

Bugs (PRIO 3)
--------
+ DB (?) bug: sometimes all generators go active:false
  - this must be caused by many process using same data
    and style paraller. It should be prevented with locks
    + how to implement multiuser system?
    + how about one user (aka. session) with many tabs (or windows)?

+ DB bug, data is not saved with session!!!

Different size datasets (PRIO 6)
--------
+ from 2 to 10 bars
+ another dimension
+ etc.

Others (PRIO 5)
--------

+ check what tools there are for: svg, app engine, python, etc.

+ Database tool to backup database & restore database
  + does google have one already?

+ add statistical (edited) and history (versions) to database (PRIO 4)

+ implement user accounts
 + add user accounting in database

+ check against python coding guidelines: (PRIO 1)
  http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pyguide.html

+ fix pages to XHTML compliant (PRIO 2)

+ platform stuff
  + integration to google docs
  + save data with google account

+ ui stuff
  + expandable table (now fixed to 6) (PRIO 3)
    - maybe 2 to 10 and can be vary with bar type, but needs to be 
      shown in page

+ logic
  + calculate statistics (PRIO 4)
  + calculate how much processing power is used (PRIO 6 - OPTIMIZATION)
  + read data from "live" sources (PRIO 3)
    + weather diagram
    + do we need separate "data-conversion service for this?"
  + export images as service

+ business plan (PRIO 5)

+ tutorials / docs
  + training video to Youtube (PRIO 4)

+ learn pages
  + learn basic use
  + learn template use
  (invent more user scenarios)
  + make nice examples

+ make default templates for common blogging schemas

+ make chart-api caching
  - if same request comes again it should read result from cache

Required skills
------------------------
  + marketing   - to get users
  + statistics  - to help to modify data
  + data mining - to create "default" graph pictures
  + graphical   - to make bars nicer & page nicer
  + programming - to code more flexible architecture

Ideas
------------------------

data sources directly from common sources (e.g. UN free data + stat.fi)
few nice and common examples population development through time

Dependencies
------------------------

Prototype.js
SVGWeb
SVGFig
Google App Engine / Python
(Inkscape)

Run
------------------------

cd ..
python2.5 ./app-engine/dev_appserver.py beautybar/
